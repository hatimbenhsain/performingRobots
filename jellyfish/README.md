## For Thursday 24th:


#### Ahmed, Pangna, and Hatim's JellyBot

#### 09/10/2019 Update:

We are making a jellyfish Robot. The JellyBot is composed of 3 main parts:

  1. A traction system.

  2. The jellyfish body.

  3. The 4 tentacles of the jellyfish.


The features that we've already done:

  1. Built a body out of cardboard and painted it blue, with holes for the light, with tracing paper on top.

  2. Neopixels that shift between blue and purple inside the body.

  3. Built a support for the lifting mechanism.

  4. Built the basics for the legs and tested servos on them. 


The features that we want for sure to include in our JellyBot are (including partially completed ones), which will make our JellyBot "complete":

  1. All the parts are assembled together

  2. An autonomous lifting mechanism, with a spring between the mechanism and the body.

  3. Lights coming out of the body.

  4. Legs that move automatically, using randomness or noise.


Features that we might add depending on time and constraints:

  1. Wireless controls for the lift.

  2. Lights that react to a distance sensor.

  3. Legs that react to the distance sensor, maybe becoming wilder as people get closer.

  4. Springs between the body and the legs.
  
 #### 12/10/2019 Update:
 
 (Since I haven't posted any proper update, this is going to include everything I've done so far.)
 
 The first thing I did for this project was building the outer body for the Jellybot, which I wanted to be dome-like, but still made of cardboard for the sake of lightness and not to over-complicate it. I followed [this video](https://youtu.be/W-626HKjzQI) with slight modifications:
 
  1. I used smaller shapes (7 inch)
  
  2. I stopped adding pieces after I had made a half-sphere.
  
  3. I cut circular holes for light to come out of the jellyfish, and I glued tracing paper to filter it. I also cut a hole on top to carry the Jellybot up and down.
  
  4. I painted it with a light coat of blue.
