The videos show small robots based on Thomas the Train toys that do various things such as swim, attack balloons, crawl on walls, etc. The person who built them is a Japanese youtuber called Y NAKAJIMA. I chose these videos to show because they're what I thought of when I read the part about robots being a fusion of "beauty and monstrosity" in our reading, particularly the part with the small and the bigger robot interacting. Watching that part made me go "aww" but I was puzzled by how I could find something so monstrous and disturbing-looking cute. In class we raised the association of something small and something bigger with motherly love. 

I also found it interesting how giving the robots the face of Thomas the Train, a children animation character, made them look so much more disturbing. The movement of the eyes with the Servo motors also kind of adds to the uncanniness. 

## Final Project Proposal

Idea 1: Orac\ebot

A robot that reads your future, inspired by fortuneteller machines. The robot would be constituted of a massive head that looks like an easter statue but with stereotypical female fortuneteller features. The head would be able to turn on a small base, which would be able to move around with a set of wheels. Features I would incorporate are LED strips behind the eyes that change colors, and Servo motors that move the eyelids up and down every now and then. I would also put a speaker inside of the robot so that the oracle would be able to speak. Finally, I would have a hole in the body for a coin to be dropped and "activate" it (get your fortune told). 

I really wanted to incorporate spider legs in my project but I figured that it would be too difficult, so I figured that it would still be aesthetically nice to have spider legs that dangle from the base while the wheels actually move it.
