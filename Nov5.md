The videos show small robots based on Thomas the Train toys that do various things such as swim, attack balloons, crawl on walls, etc. The person who built them is a Japanese youtuber called Y NAKAJIMA. I chose these videos to show because they're what I thought of when I read the part about robots being a fusion of "beauty and monstrosity" in our reading, particularly the part with the small and the bigger robot interacting. Watching that part made me go "aww" but I was puzzled by how I could find something so monstrous and disturbing-looking cute. In class we raised the association of something small and something bigger with motherly love. 

I also found it interesting how giving the robots the face of Thomas the Train, a children animation character, made them look so much more disturbing. The movement of the eyes with the Servo motors also kind of adds to the uncanniness.
