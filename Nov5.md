The videos show small robots based on Thomas the Train toys that do various things such as swim, attack balloons, crawl on walls, etc. The person who built them is a Japanese youtuber called Y NAKAJIMA. I chose these videos to show because they're what I thought of when I read the part about robots being a fusion of "beauty and monstrosity" in our reading, particularly the part with the small and the bigger robot interacting. Watching that part made me go "aww" but I was puzzled by how I could find something so monstrous and disturbing-looking cute. In class we raised the association of something small and something bigger with motherly love. 

I also found it interesting how giving the robots the face of Thomas the Train, a children animation character, made them look so much more disturbing. The movement of the eyes with the Servo motors also kind of adds to the uncanniness. 

## Final Project Proposal

Idea 1: Orac\ebot

A robot that reads your future, inspired by fortuneteller machines. The robot would be constituted of a massive head that looks like an easter statue but with stereotypical female fortuneteller features, with 3 eyes. The head would be able to turn on a small base, which would be able to move around with a set of wheels. Features I would incorporate are LED strips behind the eyes that change colors, and Servo motors that move the eyelids up and down every now and then. I would also put a speaker inside of the robot so that the oracle would be able to speak. Finally, I would have a hole in the body for a coin to be dropped and "activate" it (get your fortune told). 

In its idle state, the robot would make small movements around and blink from time to time, except for its third eye which would remain closed. It would also say some pre-recorded voicelines pre-processed to sound robotic, kind of like (https://youtu.be/8tg5f09itnI)[GLaDOS's voice in Portal]. It would say stuff like "Downloading future..." "When all living beings die I will remain" "Have you opened your third eye yet?". 

If we go the small shorts route like Ahmed(?) suggested, my oracle could walk on stage first and give a quick introduction to the performances and walk off. For the actual performance, I would imagine that either a performer or an audience member would walk to the robot and put a coin inside to hear the fortune. Then, lights would start flashing back and forth in different colors behind the oracle's eyes, and its third eye would open. The robot would read the person's fortune. Examples of possible lines are: "Your favorite color is #4287f5" (during which her eyes would shine in that color), "You will have 679921863 children", "You are a comprehensive puzzling abiding whispering ambiguous person". The specific values like the number of children and adjectives would be randomly generated. It would conclude the fortune with something like "You are a being of flesh and soon you will die. I will remain". The lines could be either pre-recorded or enacted by an actor with a mic in the back, and being processed to sound robotic. While the robot is talking, it would also be moving around the person it's reading the fortune of and looking at them. Ideally this would happen automatically, but I figure that this would be too hard since the person might move around, so bluetooth controls would probably make more sense.

I really wanted to incorporate spider legs in my project but I figured that it would be too difficult, so I figured that it would still be aesthetically nice to have spider legs that dangle from the base while the wheels actually move it.
