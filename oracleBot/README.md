## Update 15/11/2019:

I emailed Jon to help me with building my robot for Sunday, so I made sketches of all the parts I need to make:

The essential parts I need to make are:

- A circular or cubic base for the wheels to be attached, and with a fake coin slot hole.

- A thin circular piece to rotate on top of the base. I might just use Angelina's old base for this.

- Rods to attach on the circular piece to support the face.

- A face piece with plywood to wrap around the rods. Needs to have holes for 3 eyes and for mouth.

Less essential:

- A nose.

- A hair/hat piece.


In the meantime, I worked on making a Max patch that makes a robot voice. What it basically does it modulate the pitch of the input randomly every second.
